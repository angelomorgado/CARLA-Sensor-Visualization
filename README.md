# Carla Sensor Visualization

Allows to visualize an ego vehicle's sensors using PyGame.

The main drawback is that this isn't dynamic, only allows pre determined sensors

## TODO

- Make it dynamic for different vehicles with different sensors

- Maybe make a web client of this that lets you chose different vehicles and verify if they have sensors and all. Cool idea.

- Put the sensors information in a JSON so the code doesn't need to be rewritten

- GNSS, IMU, Collision, Lane Invasion, Obstacles
