# Carla Sensor Visualization

Allows to visualize an ego vehicle's sensors using PyGame.

It is dynamic, being able to create new vehicle configurations based on Json files.

## TODO

- Maybe make a web client of this that lets you chose different vehicles and verify if they have sensors and all. Cool idea.
